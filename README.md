# game
There are two games here.<br/>
Have used tab view to switch between two views here. <br/>
One is the Jackpot game and the other is the fortune cookie game (there is a separate app for this already). <br/>
Have made use of the picker view to scroll between the images. <br/>
So many objects from the object library has been used here. <br/>
It is written in Objective C, Xcode 6.0.1, iOS 8.<br/><br/>

Go ahead and play the jackpot game, if you get any three items same during the spin, you get the jackpot.
